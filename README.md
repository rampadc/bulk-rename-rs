# Bulk Rename[rs]

Bulk Rename [rs] aims to be a cross-platform bulk renaming tool. Greatly inspired by Windows' bulk rename utility, this tool aims to achieve just that cross-platform.

Written in Rust using the `egui` library.

This is a work in progress. Only the file browser is working as intended. The rest is all UI work so far.

## Develop locally

`cargo run`
